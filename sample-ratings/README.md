## QuickBlox Android Ratings Sample
**Ratings module is marked as 'obsolete' by QuickBlox team and we highly recommend to use [Custom Objects module](http://quickblox.com/developers/SimpleSample-customObjects-android) to build Ratings / Leaderboard stuff.**
<br><br>

This is a code sample for [QuickBlox](http://quickblox.com/) platform. It is a great way for developers using QuickBlox platform to learn how to integrate ratings into yours apps.

This is an Android build, it demonstrates how to work with [Ratings](http://quickblox.com/developers/Ratings) QuickBlox module.
It allows to rate any items (e.g. films, products, music,...) and see average ratings

It shows how to:
<ul>
<li> Rate some items</li>
<li> Get average ratings </li>
</ul>

Go to project page on QuickBlox Developers Section -- <http://quickblox.com/developers/SimpleSample-ratings-android>

Or clone project here and start to work with the code.
